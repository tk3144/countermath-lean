# Countermath.lean

This file stores statements checkable by SlimCheck or LSpec's built-in
exhaustion for bounded quantification.

Checkable statements involve decidable propositions over discrete types
(Naturals, Integers, Bool, etc.).

Uncheckable statements (e.g., involving Real numbers or non-decidable
properties) are stored in `Uncheckable.lean`.

-- 1. Simple Unit Test
#lspec test "Nat inequality" (4 ≠ 5)
-- ✓ ∃: Nat inequality

-- 2. Composed Unit Tests
-- Fixed the implicit argument error by annotating the empty list type
#lspec test "Boolean logic" (true && true) <|

-- to verify properties without requiring the full SlimCheck engine.
#lspec test "Small Nat addition" <| ∀ n, n < 10 → n + 5 < 16

section Statement23
/-!
Statement:
Give an example of a nonempty subset $U$ of $\mathbf{R}^2$ such that $U$ is
closed under scalar multiplication, but $U$ is not a subspace of $\mathbf{R}^2$.

Rationale:
$U = \{(x, y) \in \mathbf{R}^2 : |x|=|y|\}$. For $(x, y) \in U$ and $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$,
it follows $\lambda(x, y) = (\lambda x, \lambda y)$, so $|\lambda x| = |\lambda||x| = |\lambda||y| = |\lambda y|$.
Therefore, $\lambda(x, y) \in U$. On the other hand, consider $a=(1,-1), b=(1,1) \in U$.
Then, $a+b=(1,-1)+(1,1)=(2,0) \notin U$. So, $U$ is not a subspace of $\mathbf{R}^2$.

CHECKABLE:
LSpec can verify the counterexample $(1,-1) + (1,1) = (2,0)$ and confirm
that $(2,0)$ does not satisfy the condition $|x| = |y|$.

  let b := (1, 1)
  let sum := (a.1 + b.1, a.2 + b.2) -- (2, 0)
  -- 'a' and 'b' are in U, but their sum is not
  inU a && inU b && !inU sum
)
-- ✓ ∃: S23: Counterexample: Sum of elements in U is not in U

end Statement23


section Statement24
/-!
Statement:
"Prove that the union of two subspaces of $V$ is a subspace of $V$ if and
only if one of the subspaces is contained in the other."

Rationale:
To prove this one way, suppose for purposes of contradiction that for $U_1$ and
$U_2$, which are subspaces of $V$, that $U_1 \cup U_2$ is a subspace and neither
is completely contained within the other. In other words, $U_1 \nsubseteq U_2$
and $U_2 \nsubseteq U_1$. We will show that you can pick a vector $v \in U_1$
and a vector $u \in U_2$ such that $v+u \notin U_1 \cup U_2$, proving that
if $U_1 \cup U_2$ is a subspace, one must be completely contained inside the other.

If $U_1 \nsubseteq U_2$, we can pick a $v \in U_1$ such that $v \notin U_2$.
If $U_2 \nsubseteq U_1$, then we can pick a $u \in U_2$ such that $u \notin U_1$.
If $v+u \in U_1 \cup U_2$, then $v+u$ must be in $U_1$ or $U_2$. But:
- $v+u \in U_1 \Rightarrow v+u+(-v) \in U_1 \Rightarrow u \in U_1$
- $v+u \in U_2 \Rightarrow v+u+(-u) \in U_2 \Rightarrow v \in U_2$

This is a contradiction, as each element was defined to not be in these subspaces.
Thus our initial assumption must have been wrong, and $U_1 \subseteq U_2$ or
$U_2 \subseteq U_1$. To prove the other way, let $U_1 \subseteq U_2$ (WLOG).
Then $U_1 \cup U_2 = U_2$. Since $U_2$ is a subspace, the union is as well.


CHECKABLE:
LSpec can verify the logic of the counterexample by testing specific subspaces
(like the axes of a plane) that are not contained in one another.

We verify the counterexample from the rationale.
Let U1 be the X-axis and U2 be the Y-axis. Neither is contained in the
other. We check that while (1,0) and (0,1) are in the union, their sum
(1,1) is not.

end Statement24


section Statement36
/-!
Statement:
The polynomial $x^2 - \sqrt{2}$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{2}]$.

Rationale:
If $x^2 - \sqrt{2}$ were reducible, it would have a root $a + b\sqrt{2}$ where
$a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$.
Plugging this root into the polynomial gives:
$(a + b\sqrt{2})^2 - \sqrt{2} = 0$
$a^2 + 2b^2 + (2ab - 1)\sqrt{2} = 0$
For this to hold, the coefficient $(2ab - 1)$ must be $0$, meaning $2ab = 1$.

CHECKABLE:
LSpec can use SlimCheck to sample integers $a$ and $b$ to verify that $2ab$ is never $1$.
-/

#lspec check "S36: Rationale contradiction: 2ab is never 1 for integers" <|
  ∀ (a b : Int), 2 * a * b != 1
-- ✓ ∃: S36: Rationale contradiction: 2ab is never 1 for integers

end Statement36


section Statement155
/-!
Statement:
Two initial segments of natural numbers N_m and N_n are equivalent
if and only if m = n.

Rationale:
The rationale uses induction to prove that if two initial segments
are equivalent, their predecessors must also be equivalent,
leading to a contradiction if the sizes differ.

CHECKABLE:
LSpec can verify the truth of this equivalence by comparing
the sizes of the sets.

-- 1. Test specific cases (m = n and m ≠ n)
#lspec test "S155: Equivalent segments (5, 5)" (
  let m := 5
  let n := 5
  (m == n) == (Fintype.card (Fin m) == Fintype.card (Fin n))
)
-- ✓ ∃: S155: Equivalent segments (5, 5)

#lspec test "S155: Non-equivalent segments (3, 7)" (
  let m := 3
  let n := 7
  (m == n) == (Fintype.card (Fin m) == Fintype.card (Fin n))
)
-- ✓ ∃: S155: Non-equivalent segments (3, 7)


-- 2. Use 'check' to verify the logic for random pairs
#lspec check "S155: General equivalence for natural numbers" <|
  ∀ (m n : Nat), (m == n) ↔ (Fintype.card (Fin m) == Fintype.card (Fin n))
-- ✓ ∃: S155: General equivalence for natural numbers

end Statement155


section Statement249
/-!
Statement:
Let $A$ be a $*$-algebra and $A'$ be its Cayley-Dickson construction.
Then $A'$ is not a real algebra.

Rationale:
A real algebra is defined by the property that conjugation is the identity
($a^* = a$). In the Cayley-Dickson construction, the conjugate of an
element $(x, y)$ is $(x^*, -y)$. For $(x, y) = (x^*, -y)$ to hold, $y$
must be $0$. Since a $*$-algebra is a unitary division algebra, it
contains a non-zero identity element ($1 \neq 0$), allowing us to
construct elements where $y \neq 0$.

CHECKABLE:
LSpec can verify this by checking if the conjugation function
is the identity function.

-- -------------------

end Statement249


section Statement259
/-!
Statement:
If two elements commute, their powers commute. However, if powers commute,
it does not imply the base elements commute.

Rationale:
In any semigroup, $a \circ b = b \circ a \implies a^m \circ b^n = b^n \circ a^m$.
To show the converse is false, consider the Dihedral group $D_3$.
Let $a$ be a rotation of $120^\circ$ ($a^3 = e$) and $b$ be a reflection ($b^2 = e$).
Then $a^3 \circ b^2 = e \circ e = e$ and $b^2 \circ a^3 = e \circ e = e$.
The powers commute, but $a \circ b \neq b \circ a$.

CHECKABLE:
The forward direction can be sampled using SlimCheck on integers.
The counterexample in $D_3$ is a finite check that evaluates to true or false.
The forward implication can be sampled using property-based testing on a
commutative structure like integers.
